This repository is a collection of various data structures and algorithms implemented in c++ programming languages. Data Structures and Algorithms are the backbone of computer science. They help in organizing and storing data efficiently, as well as in solving complex problems in an optimized way. This repository is aimed at providing various implementations of different data structures and algorithms in multiple programming languages. The code is intended to be used as a reference or a starting point for implementing these data structures and algorithms in your projects. The following algorithms are implemented in this repository: Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort) Searching algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search) Graph algorithms (Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm) String algorithms (Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm, Rabin-Karp Algorithm)
